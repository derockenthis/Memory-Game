## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- https://fdossena.com/?p=html5cool/buttons/i.frag (button css)
- https://www.rapidtables.com/web/html/html-codes/html-code-heart.html (heart html)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- What was challenging was understanding how to work with css, to make more interactive buttons, and figuring out how javascript and html interact. I
overcame this by googling questions, and looking at my past projects. For example I wanted the start and stop buttons to be more interactive like the 
4 game buttons, so I found a way for the border to transition colors smoothly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I know that we can use different languages to connect to modify the html and pass through data. I was wondering if we would be able to create more 
interactive games such as this with a language such as python. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would want to add another game feature, such as one that would shift the game blocks around, and 
another feature that would play a sound when you win; also I would have liked to make the website look more modern.
